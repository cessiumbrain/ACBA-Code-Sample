  "description": "I wanted to do a quick but light redesign of the existing website for this assignment. I used bootstrap for a lot of the features (carousel, responsive navbar, dropdown menus and responsive layout).   I used font awesome icons for the social media and contact icons in the footer.   I used a utility called tagbox to embed the twitter feed.  I like it better than twitter's default service.  It can integrate other social media  accounts and is itself responsive, so when a user views the site on mobile and bootstrap expands that column to fill the whole screen, it will array the tweets across that column, not just in a single column.",
